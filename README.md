# Optimization-Model
 Optimization Model Project  This project demonstrates how to build and implement an optimization model to find the most efficient and cost-effective solution for a given problem using mathematical modeling and computational optimization techniques. 

The project focuses on formulating a real-world problem as a mathematical model, defining decision variables, constraints, and an objective function, and then solving it using popular Python optimization libraries.
